In this project, we were tasked with creating the Chada Tech Clock for the client's website. The clock should have the following features:

A 12-hour clock displayed in standard 12-hour format (e.g. 12:00:00, 12:59:59)
A 24-hour clock displayed in standard 24-hour format (e.g. 00:00:00, 23:59:59)
Both clocks displayed side by side
A menu that allows the user to add one hour, one minute, one second, or exit the program
I encountered some difficulties while working on this project. My program was initially ending prematurely and I was unable to identify the cause. I sought help from my coworkers and used peer tutoring to resolve the issue.

I think that my program could be improved by running in real-time using the internal computer clock. This would make the program more effective and easier to use. Additionally, I encountered issues with getting the program to run continuously. Whenever I made a selection from the menu, the code would end and I was unable to understand why.

I found the zybooks to be confusing in my classes, but I found that peer tutoring, W3 schools, and helpful YouTube videos were very useful in my learning process. I also have colleagues who are knowledgeable in C++ and work in a field that requires programming skills, which has been helpful in my learning journey.

All of the concepts presented in this course have been challenging for me. I had difficulty understanding loops until this class. Ironically, it was the class on C++, which I was most fearful of taking, that helped me finally grasp the concept of loops.

As someone who values attention to detail, I prioritize the use of whitespace and avoid using abbreviations as they can be ambiguous. I believe that this attention to detail has helped me to create code that is readable and easy to maintain. While I have not made frequent use of comments in my work thus far, I recognize the value of incorporating them in order to facilitate revisiting code after extended periods of inactivity or for the benefit of others who may be working on the same project.
